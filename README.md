# filler

Create a player to fight other students on the world famous (or infamous) Filler board.
The concept is simple: two players gain points by placing on a board, one after the other,
the game piece obtained by the game master (in the form of an executable Ruby program).
The game ends when the game piece cannot be placed anymore. 

To run the project you need to run Makefile in the main folder and then go to resourses
and run the qscript: sh qscript.sh.

To colorize the output you should run the zscript.sh in resourses.

In _script.sh you can change the enemy for daleksan.filler from the folder players/ or
change map from the folder maps/. Also you can swap players (p1 to p2 and back).
